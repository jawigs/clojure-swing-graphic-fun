# clojure-swing-graphic-fun

Samples of using Swing to do graphics in Clojure; also demonstrates reacting to mouse and keyboard events. Each file meant to be kept as simple as possible and should be able to run by loading the file into a repl.

Files:

1. **csgf-mouse-events.clj** - Demonstrates drawing on a JPanel and responding to mouse events. Concept is very loosely based on this [Java tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html but in Clojure) with some ideas borrowed from this [Tetris implementation in Clojure](https://gist.github.com/alexander-yakushev/1207703)
